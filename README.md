<br /><br />

**The AVCS CORE VoiceAttack Profile is my framework for the game profiles I create, such as my Falcon BMS Radio Commands profile and my Ready or Not Radio Commands profile.  It provides common operations relatively executed in the active game profile, and handles profile initialization and updates to required configuration and resource files, allowing me to more easily maintain my family of AVCS profiles for either VoiceAttack V1 or V2 users. This repository presents the DEV TOOLKIT profile I use and an open source reference to all my precompiled inline functions and used within my AVCS profiles.**

# Getting Started

The AVCS CORE Profile for VoiceAttack can work as a standalone profile, but is required by any AVCS4 profile I release including AVCS4 BMS Radios and AVCS4 Ready or Not profiles.  AVCS CORE will operate in any version of VoiceAttack (at least v1.16 or higher), **including VoiceAttack V2**.  Check the 'extras' folder in the extracted download package for an optional template profile you can modify for yourself to use a "AVCS CORE" powered profile all of your own.  This is the profile which I modify for personal day-to-day use in Windows when not playing games.  The included readme file alongside it provides details and instructions for using this optional template profile.
<br /><br />
First, download the "AVCS CORE (2.0).zip" package from the link below - never download this file from anywhere else, or from others, as it should exactly match the checksum below for safety, security, and peace of mind.  Extract the contents of this `.zip` package somewhere, and open the folder "AVCS CORE (2.0)" - inside you will find the "AVCS CORE (v2.0) Profile (IMPORT THIS).vax" profile package. As the name suggests, you import this into VoiceAttack.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
*(the sample image below is from private .vax beta build and may not match checksum below it which is always accurate)*

### AVCS CORE DEV TOOLKIT Profile and App

This repro includes a tool that provides a simple application for testing parts of my inlines in Visual Studio, which is where I do most of my development and proof of concept testing before bringing them into VoiceAttack. The included profile 'AVCS CORE DEV TOOLKIT (v2.0)-Profile.vap' is the same tool I use to build all precompiled inline functions, and prepare updates to AVCS CORE.  This app also provides a means for end users to validate my compiled inline functions against the hashtable which is downloaded alongside them.

## Troubleshooting

Every command and function has been thoroughly tested, and most any exceptions or errors have been discovered and accounted for, with a profile command or inline function call gracefully ending and informing us of the error(s) through the VoiceAttack Event Log. If something goes wrong, the `AVCS_ERROR` boolean variable will become `True`, and an error message will be printed to the event log. When the debugging boolean variable has been set to True, depending on the debugging level set, errors may also be written to the errors log located in the Plugin Configuration Folder at `%AppData%\VoiceAttack-AVCS Profiles\AVCS\core_errors.log`. I have included a utility voice command to end any running commands including any profile commands currently active, just say `"Stop all commands"`.

<br /><br />

### When Things Catch Fire

When all else fails, just restart VoiceAttack. This will reset any Global VoiceAttack Variables used by the profile, and of course any internal variables the profile has set from those values. I have included a utility command I've used for a long time which can be helpful to check the current value of any VoiceAttack variable and print it out to the Event Log. Say, `"Check a Variable Value"` to open a Get Choice window which will let you select a variable type to check, and then another to enter the name of the variable. You may also say the variable type in this utility command name such as, `"Check an Integer Variable Value"`. Truly if something goes wrong, you can always just restart VoiceAttack and the AVCS CORE profile (and any AVCS4 game profile), and things should return to normal. If not, you can delete the profile(s) from VoiceAttack, and re-import them - and if all else fails, delete the entire AVCS folder (backing it up first would be highly encouraged):
<br />

**AVCS Data Path:** `%AppData%\VoiceAttack-AVCS Profiles`

<br />
The best way to troubleshoot is to create a bug report by literally saying, "Create a Bug Report", and follow instructions to call the command you have issues with.
<br /><br />
The <a href="https://voiceattack.com/VoiceAttackHelp.pdf">VoiceAttack Manual</a> is the best place for information about using the application itself, options for commands, and using actions which are common to any profile (not just AVCS). If you have any issues as you go which are more VoiceAttack related, the information is likely somewhere in that manual. There are also helpful tips on the <a href="https://voiceattack.com/howto.aspx">How To page</a>. Again, if any AVCS Profile has stopped working correctly, you can delete it and re-import it from wherever you had extracted it from the download package.

<br /><br />

### Locating Error Logs

<br />

**Log Path:** `%AppData%\VoiceAttack-AVCS Profiles\AVCS\core_errors.log`

<br />


By default, error log entries are not written unless a debug mode of level 2 or 3 is enabled.  Each error will be preceded by a timestamp and a debug line entry from the action list where it originated. There may be some complex information about the command which executed, any sub-command chains, and all sorts of data I would not expect anyone to understand.  You can present error logs to me and I'll be happy to find where the issue has occurred.  Just say, "Create a Bug Report", and follow the prompts to use the command which caused an issue, and then say, "Ready", or "Done", when it is complete (or errored out) to save the report.  A browser will open where you can paste this report - feel free to review before posting, there should never be any identifying or sensitive information included.

<br />


You may also enable debugging mode, if desired, such as saying, "Enable Debug Mode Level 4", for message printing without writing to file.  By enabling debugging, a larger amount of data will be printed to the VoiceAttack Event Log, which will be the same as what is printed in the errors log file. If it is not apparent what went wrong, you can always contact me and I'll do my best to help out.

<br /><br />
